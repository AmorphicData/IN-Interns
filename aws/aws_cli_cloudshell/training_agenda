What is an API

AWS has several API behind the scenes which actually does the job for us.
There are multiple way to interact with API - User Interface, libraries - SDKs and CLI

Install AWS CLI - brew install awscli
aws help

Connect to AWS Account and Export the keys
Run a small command:
aws ec2 describe-instances

Discussion over aws config and aws credentials

Why config and creds over setting default? - multiple aws accounts at same time

Set the profile and then run the aws commands

Run multiple commands with usage of profile and region

Multiple outputs - text and json

Filter the data using query.

What if you donâ€™t have your laptop or AWS cli is not configured or not working - we can use aws cloudshell - It is mimic of your local terminal with basic things like python, aws cli etc.

Connect to cloudshell, and run aws commands,
Run python commands, upload a file and download a file
