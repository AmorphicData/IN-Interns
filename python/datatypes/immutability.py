# Number
my_num = 10
# Attempting to alter the value of an integer results in the creation of a new object

# String
my_str = 'Hello, world!'
# Strings are also immutable. Any modification results in a new string object

# Tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# Tuples are immutable, but they can reference mutable objects
